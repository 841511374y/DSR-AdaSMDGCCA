"Code-DS-SCCA" is a package written in Matlab and the name stands for "Identify connectome between genotypes and brain network phenotypes via deep self-reconstruction sparse canonical correlation analysis"
This repository contains the following files:

Main.m is the main function of the DS-SCCA package. 

main_SR.m Performs network parameters in an optimum state.
f_SR.m calculates the the self-representation matrix. 
f_sCCA.m is our proposed algorithm that compute canonical correlations at the outputs. 

deepnet is network toolbox
